  "description": "- **Aurora Capsules** is the Genesis collection for the upcoming NFT Collection Super Space Defenders.\n\n     - Commander Minerva Bellatrix stole 1,111 from the hands of the Yamamoto Family. Those capsules will be allocated to the most loyal and talented soldiers throughout special events. Each Capsule works as a mint pass that gives you access to purchase up to 3 Super Space Defenders… it’s up to you to hold the capsule, buy some others or sell them to the highest bidder.\n\n     - [Super Space Defenders](https://www.ssdefenders.io) "
