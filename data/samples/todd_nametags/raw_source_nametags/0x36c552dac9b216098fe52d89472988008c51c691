  "description": "To experience each piece in its entirety, please use headphones and use the website link in the upper right corner of each piece. \n\nAll organic creatures have hearts. A heart beats faster as a function of physical exertion or fear. When a gazelle encounters a lion, its heart rapidly increases in beating frequency to pump sufficient oxygen through the cardiovascular system to escape.\n\nWhat about synthetic creatures? Does Ethereum have a heart? If so, can we measure it?\n\nEach Consensus Heartbeat is a story of the historical activity of the EVM. Consensus Heartbeats are an interactive on-chain generative art project and are the second project in the Unravelling set (https://unravelling.xyz/). \n\nThe first project was Void Attractors (https://opensea.io/collection/void-attractors)."
