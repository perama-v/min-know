  "description": "by Aaron Penne in partnership with FingerprintsDAO\n\nA long form generative art project that asks the question: Is the art in the code or the output? For on-chain generative artwork it is both, simultaneously. Tracing the lineage from Sol LeWitt’s Wall Drawings to Larva Labs’ Autoglyphs, Aaron Penne’s Within/Without decouples the artist's instructions from the visual output, and those instructions are interpreted according to some element of chance.\n\nThe familiar Autoglyph-like structure is made up of primitive forms: lines, circles, and squares. In WW these are translated to create complex rectangular structures, dreamlike gradients, and soft edges made of pixelated digital artifacts.\n\nMore details: https://aaronpenne.io/work/withinwithout"
