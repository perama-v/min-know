  "description": "N. Dean Christensen (aka Deansace, b. 1992, Louisville, KY) is an award winning figurative painter living and working in Brooklyn, NY. His body of work is an ongoing commentary on the influence of the smartphone in our lives with an underlying message to eat more broccoli. His work has exhibited in NYC and he has recently generated a cult following (Brock Leegue) on Instagram from painting his own satirical blank-faced selfies and his character \"Brock Lee\" into the works of contemporary masters. He currently has his sights set on NFTs and their limitless potential to dismantle and restructure the traditional art world. "
